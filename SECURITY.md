## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          | Notes |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: | Current stable - Active development |
| 0.9.x   | :warning:          | Legacy - Critical fixes only |
| < 0.9   | :x:                | End of life |

## Scope

This repository contains automation testing tools that interact with:
- Git repositories and version control systems
- File system operations (read/write/execute)
- Subprocess execution for git commands
- Network operations (git push/pull to remote repositories)

## Security Considerations

### Execution Environment
- **Test Mode**: Script detects detached HEAD and disables write operations
- **File Permissions**: Generated files use standard 644 permissions
- **Process Isolation**: Uses subprocess module for git operations
- **Credential Handling**: Relies on system git configuration (SSH keys/tokens)

### Data Handling
- **File Locking**: Implements fcntl-based locking for concurrent JSON access
- **Input Validation**: Configuration files parsed with error handling
- **Logging**: Structured logging without credential exposure
- **Temporary Files**: Limited temporary file creation with cleanup

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Contact Methods
- **Primary**: Create a private security advisory via GitHub
- **Alternative**: Email security concerns to repository maintainer
- **Response Time**: Initial acknowledgment within 48 hours

### Vulnerability Categories

#### High Priority
- Arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities
- Credential exposure or theft
- Unauthorized repository access
- File system escape conditions

#### Medium Priority
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service conditions
- Configuration manipulation
- Log injection attacks

#### Low Priority
- Resource consumption issues
- Non-sensitive information leaks
- Race conditions without security impact

### Assessment Process
1. **Initial Review** (24-48 hours): Vulnerability validation and classification
2. **Impact Analysis** (3-5 days): Scope assessment and exploitation potential
3. **Resolution Planning** (1-2 weeks): Fix development and testing
4. **Disclosure Timeline** (30-90 days): Coordinated disclosure based on severity

### Expected Outcomes
- **Accepted**: Security advisory published, fix released, credit provided
- **Declined**: Detailed explanation of why issue doesn't qualify as vulnerability
- **Duplicate**: Reference to existing report or known issue

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Run in isolated test environments when possible
- Use dedicated git credentials for automation
- Monitor repository activity for unexpected changes
- Implement branch protection rules on target repositories
- Regular audit of generated files and commit patterns

### For Contributors
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Validate all external inputs
- Use secure coding practices for file operations
- Test in detached HEAD mode before live deployment
- Document security implications of new features

## Incident Response

In case of confirmed security incident:
1. Immediate containment actions will be documented
2. Affected users notified within 72 hours
3. Post-incident review and preventive measures implemented
4. Public disclosure after resolution (if applicable)

## Compliance

This project implements security measures appropriate for:
- Development environment testing tools
- Git workflow automation
- Repository management utilities
- Educational and research purposes

**Note**: This tool is designed for controlled testing environments. Production deployment requires additional security hardening and risk assessment.

## Security Considerations
This repository contains automation tools that interact with git repositories. 
Always run in isolated test environments when possible.
